<p>OK, so maybe their mouth didn&rsquo;t utter that last part, but their eyes damn well did.</p>
<p>This hasn&rsquo;t been an entirely uncommon event since I picked up <a href="http://colemak.com/" title="Colemak keyboard layout">colemak </a>a couple years ago and then took it a step further and switched my window manager to <a href="http://xmonad.org/" title="xmonad tiling window manager">xmonad</a>, thus rendering my computer useless to about 99.999999% of the population. Of course, it&rsquo;s usually friends or acquaintances who eventually understand what&rsquo;s going in so it&rsquo;s not too big a deal.</p>
<p>I thought about it a little and it reminded of when I was in high school and, after a replacing a couple stolen TI-83s, I bought an HP 49G calculator.  One of the best purchases I&rsquo;ve ever made (still use it on a daily basis!).  It was never stolen, despite being left unattended a couple times, because no one knew what the hell it was.  It also had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation" title="reverse polish notation">RPN</a>, a superior entry method for calculations which, like xmonad and colemak, very few people could actually use.  So, when the occasion arose for one of my fellow pupils to borrow it I wouldn&rsquo;t have much of a choice but to say no.  Well, if I happened to be in a particularly sadistic mood I handed it over so I could watch them struggle for a bit whilst chortling with glee.  Anyway, after a while no one asked to use my calculator anymore.  A dream come true for a young, slightly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysophobia" title="mysophobia on wiki">mysophobic</a>, introvert!</p>
<p>However, there was one negative externality: the RPN mode soon became instinctual and I lost my ability to use the algebraic entry common on the TI calcs.  I looked like a fumbling fool whenever I had to borrow a &lsquo;lator from someone, which was my karmic retribution I suppose.</p>
<p>So here I am today and the cycle has repeated itself.  I&rsquo;ve lost my proficiency with qwerty layouts.  Several months ago my boss handed me the keyboard in the conference room to demonstrate, to the CEO nonetheless, an app we wrote.  Well it took me approximately an eternity to type in a damn username/password (the alphanumeric stuff isn&rsquo;t too bad, but the effect of all those typos gets quadrupled because the correction mechanism (i.e. backspace) has itself been switched with the caps lock, grrr) .  Although no one actually said anything, I knew what everyone was thinking: &ldquo;This guy is a programmer!?.&rdquo;</p>
