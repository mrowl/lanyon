<p>Ah, the cold brew.  Nothing quite hits the spot on a hot summer
morning.  I (over?) indulged in it frequently over the past few months and at this point I’d say unequivocally that I prefer it to hot coffee, regardless of
the season.  Most of the people online were using regular drippers to
home brew the stuff so I figured I’d write this guide for using a
French press, a most magical apparatus for both hot and cold alike.
Though, it’s so simple and intuitive as to render a tutorial nearly
superfluous.</p>

<p>In any event, after a bit of experimentation I’ve settled on the
process and measurements for extracting the optimal cold brew cup from
a French press.  I haven’t found the ideal beans yet, as I prefer to
try something new every time, but I generally opt for something dark
that’s heavy on the chocolate notes.  I’ve noticed the chocolate
flavor, for which I have a particular affinity, really gets amplified
with the cold brew process.  Recently I rather enjoyed the <a href="http://www.stinkybklyn.com/">Stinky
Bkln</a> blend (ultimately from
<a href="http://www.damicofoods.com/">D'Amico</a>) and a Guatemalan roast from
<a href="http://www.gorillacoffee.com">Gorilla</a>.</p>

<p>Without further ado…</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul><li>0.5 cups fresh <strong>coarsely</strong> ground coffee (the usual for a French press)</li>
<li>3.5 cups water</li>
<li>A jug of sorts. I use a glass (no BPA!) quart bottle. Previous tenant: milk.</li>
<li>Cold storage area (e.g. a refrigerator)</li>
</ul><h2>Process</h2>

<ol><li>Pour the coffee into the French press.</li>
<li>Add the water and stir vigorously with a spoon.</li>
<li>Put the <em>uncovered</em> press into cold storage for 12-24 hours.</li>
<li>Put the jug in next to the press (pouring the cold brew into a
warm container sucks).</li>
<li>After the time has elapsed, take the brewed coffee out</li>
<li>Break the coffee cake on the top and lightly stir.</li>
<li>Scrape off the “fines” that remain hovering
(<a href="http://vimeo.com/2222293">demonstration</a>).</li>
<li>Cover and press!</li>
<li>Let it sit for a minute or so.</li>
<li>Unload the cold brew into the cool container (or straight into a
mug) and partake.</li>
</ol><p>The length of the brewing process is up for debate; some  swear by 24
hours and others 12.  I always do the latter mostly because I don’t
want to go sans French press for a whole day and it works out nicely
to do the preparation after dinner, let it sit overnight, and then
have it waiting in the morning.</p>

<p>One of the great things about cold brewing is it doesn’t go bad within the hour like hot coffee.  You can brew a large quantity and store it in the fridge for up to a week without tarnishing the flavor.</p>

<p>Note: I’m sorely lacking in the precision measurement department at
the moment, but I’ll hopefully acquire a scale soon and write an
update with more accurate numbers.</p>
